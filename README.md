# Flask-RestX
Testing API handling using Flask RestX


The APIs can:
- POST data of shelf and items to server
- GET data of specific Shelves and their items
- GET list of all shelves and items
- GET data of specific item
- When an item is POST-ed it is automatically added to it's corresponding Shelf list.

This mini-project is connected to SQLlite3 which serves as the database.
